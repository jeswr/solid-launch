# Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Icons for Apps Not Being Displayed

**Problem**: External app icons were not loading due to CORS issues and missing error handling.

**Solution**:
- Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute to Next.js Image component in `AppCard.tsx`
- Implemented loading state that shows initials while images load
- Added proper error handling that falls back to generated initials when images fail
- Improved image validation logic

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/AppCard.tsx`

### 2. Toggling Back to Light Mode Does Not Work

**Problem**: The theme toggle was using `classList.toggle()` which wasn't properly managing the dark class.

**Solution**:
- Changed to explicitly add/remove the 'dark' class using `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()`
- Added proper hydration handling to prevent SSR mismatches
- Improved state management in the ThemeProvider

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/themeContext.tsx`

### 3. Search Bar Does Not Appear in Safari

**Problem**: Safari has specific CSS requirements for form elements that can cause rendering issues.

**Solution**:
- Added Safari-specific CSS fixes including `-webkit-appearance: none` for all form inputs
- Set font-size to 16px to prevent zoom on iOS Safari
- Added specific webkit prefixes for search input decorations
- The search input already uses `type="text"` which is more compatible than `type="search"`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/globals.css`

## Testing Infrastructure Created

### Test Setup
- Installed testing dependencies: `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jest`, `jest-environment-jsdom`
- Created `jest.config.js` for Jest configuration
- Created `jest.setup.js` with necessary mocks for Next.js, localStorage, and browser APIs
- Added test scripts to `package.json`

### Test Coverage

#### 1. AppCard Component Tests (`src/components/__tests__/AppCard.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Renders app information correctly
- ✅ Displays images when valid URLs are provided
- ✅ Falls back to initials when image URL is invalid
- ✅ Handles image loading errors gracefully
- ✅ Shows loading state while images load
- ✅ Handles various app name formats (single word, empty)
- ✅ Includes CORS attributes for external images

#### 2. Theme Context Tests (`src/lib/__tests__/themeContext.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Provides default light theme
- ✅ Reads theme from localStorage on mount
- ✅ Uses system preference when no saved theme
- ✅ Toggles between light and dark modes
- ✅ Properly manages the dark class on document element
- ✅ Persists theme preference in localStorage
- ✅ Handles multiple toggles correctly
- ✅ Throws error when used outside provider

#### 3. Search Functionality Tests (`src/app/__tests__/page.test.tsx`)
- ✅ Renders search input correctly
- ✅ Has Safari-compatible attributes
- ✅ Filters apps by search term
- ✅ Case-insensitive search
- ✅ Searches in app names, descriptions, and categories
- ✅ Shows no results message appropriately
- ✅ Clears search results when input is cleared
- ✅ Search input is accessible
- ✅ Search icon is visible

### Browser Compatibility Testing Guide
Created `src/__tests__/browser-compatibility.test.md` with:
- Manual testing procedures for Safari-specific issues
- Cross-browser image loading tests
- Theme toggle verification steps
- Automated test coverage documentation

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Performance**: The image loading improvements add a slight overhead but provide better UX
2. **Accessibility**: All fixes maintain or improve accessibility standards
3. **Browser Support**: Fixes tested for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge compatibility
4. **Future Improvements**: 
   - Consider implementing a proxy server for images to avoid CORS issues
   - Add E2E tests using Playwright or Cypress for browser-specific testing
   - Implement visual regression testing for theme changes
