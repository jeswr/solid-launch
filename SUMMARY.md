# Solid App Launcher - Project Summary

## Overview

The Solid App Launcher is a modern web application that serves as a centralized hub for discovering and launching applications in the Solid ecosystem. It's designed to be deployed at `start.solidproject.org`.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic App Discovery
- Reads application metadata from RDF/Turtle data sources
- Supports both remote (GitHub) and local data sources
- Automatically merges and deduplicates applications

### 2. Beautiful User Interface
- Modern, responsive design following Solid Project branding
- Royal Lavender (#7C4DFF) as the primary brand color
- Clean, card-based layout similar to app stores
- Smooth animations using Framer Motion

### 3. Search & Filter Capabilities
- Real-time search across app names, descriptions, and categories
- Category-based filtering
- Results counter showing matching applications

### 4. Multiple View Modes
- Grid view: Card-based layout for visual browsing
- List view: Compact layout for quick scanning

### 5. Smart Image Handling
- Displays app icons when available
- Generates attractive color-coded placeholders for apps without images
- Uses app initials for visual identification

## Technical Implementation

### Stack
- **Next.js 15**: React framework with App Router
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **N3.js**: RDF parsing library
